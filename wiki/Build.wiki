#summary How to (re)build the library

= Build =

<code>make</code> into root directory to compile the two library (libFunction and libParserEffex)

<code>make test</code> into root directory to compile the two library and build a small test program (Parser/Exemple.cpp) 

The Makefile is only available for Windows architecture (for the moment...)
