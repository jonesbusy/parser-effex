This library provide various methods to parse a mathematical function of type f(x) or a simple expression.

A tree structure is available to represent the different expressions. So, it is possible to calculate different values of the variable x for the same function.

Different type of common functions are represented. Like cos, sin, abs, sqrt, polynomials or simple constants.
